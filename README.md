What drives the price of a car?
The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The practice dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing. The objective of this project is to determine what factors make a car more or less expensive. After detailed analysis, a clear recommendation is provided to the client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.

Business Understanding
A used car dealership is a business that purchases vehicles, repairs or refurbishes them as needed, and resells them at a profit. The core strategy involves buying cars at a low price and selling them at a higher price. To ensure faster inventory turnover and maximize profits, several factors must be consideredâ€”such as vehicle condition, market demand, demographics, features, and model type. Using a dataset of 426,000 used car sales records, I will guide the dealer through a series of detailed reports. These insights will support informed decision-making and help identify the best opportunities for successful sales.
